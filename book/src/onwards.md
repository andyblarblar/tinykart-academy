# Onwards

Well done! By this point you should have a complete, workable TinyKart.

From here, how you improve TinyKart is up to you. You could add sensors, improve algorithms, and more.

## Competition

If you are a part of ISC, we plan to have a competition at year-end, where TinyKart teams can race each other to find
the one true TinyKart.

This competition will be based around time trials. The goal is for each team to make their TinyKart as fast as possible,
while still avoiding hitting walls.

More information on this event will be given on a semester by semester basis.

## Ideas

Some ideas for areas to improve TinyKart, if I was doing it:
- Adding an encoder
  - Encoders would allow for measuring the karts speed. This allows for much more advanced control over speed, allowing
    the creation of true speed control.
- Adding sensors that can be polled faster than the LiDAR
  - You may be able to use things like sonar to get faster readings than the LiDAR, as a secondary perception source
- New algorithms
  - The path solutions provided are far from optimal. As you try tuning these, think about how our specific TinyKart
    track setup could be exploited.
