# Git

Next, let's install Git, the ubiquitous version control system. If you're on Linux, this is likely already installed.
If you're on Windows, you likely don't.

## Linux

For Linux users, it's best to install Git using a package manager, such as through apt on debain:
`sudo apt install git`

If you aren't on a debian based distro, then lets be honest, you don't need me to explain how to install Git.

## Windows 

For Windows users, run the Git installer from the project's [website](https://git-scm.com).
